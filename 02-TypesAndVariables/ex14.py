#14. The radius of the circle has the value 5, stored in a variable. 
# Write a program that calculates the area and circumference of the circle. 
# Use the algorithm below.
####
# Calculation of circle area and circumference 
# determine radius and PI
# calculate area 
# calculate circumference 
# display results
radius = 5
PI = 3.14
area = PI*radius**2
circumference = 2*PI*radius
print(f"A circle with a radius equal to {radius} has an area equal to {area}, and circumference equal to {circumference}")
