# 12.	The educational course ends with a test checking the participants' 
# knowledge. To pass the course, the participant must obtain a minimum number of points.
# Write a program that checks whether a participant has passed the course
# . Define a higher order function. Sample result:
def min_pts(limit):
    def check(pts):
        if pts >= limit:
            return True
        return False
    return check

print("=== MIN 50 PTS TO PASS ===")
assess_test = min_pts(50)
print(f"52 pts -> {assess_test(52)}")
print(f"39 pts -> {assess_test(39)}")

print("=== MIN 60 PTS TO PASS ===")
assess_test = min_pts(60)
print(f"52 pts -> {assess_test(52)}")
print(f"39 pts -> {assess_test(39)}")
