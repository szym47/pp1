# 10.	Write a program that calculates the average speed of a vehicle.
# Enter from the keyboard: a distance in km, a number of travel hours 
# and a number of travel minutes. Define a function avg_speed(distance,hours,minutes)
# that returns the calculated average speed. Sample result:
# Enter distance in km: 70
# Enter number of travel hours: 1
# Enter number of travel minutes: 23
# Average speed: 50.6 km/h 

def avg_speed(distance,hours,minutes):
    return (distance/(hours+(minutes/60)))

print(avg_speed(70,1,23))
