# (p5.py) A counter allows you to count any elements. Define a class C to create counters. The initial value of the counter is assigned when the object is created. The class contains the following methods:
# •	m1() - returns the counter value
# •	m2() - increases the counter value by 1
# •	m3() - decreases the counter value by 1
# •	m4(n) - increases/decreases the counter value by n
# •	__str__ - returns a string representation of the counter value
# Example:
# c=C(5)
# c.m1()  5
# c.m2()
# c.m1()  6
# c.m4(-8)
# c.m1()  -2
# c.m3()
# c.m1()  -3
# c.m4(10)
# c.m1()  7
# c.__str__()  "7"
