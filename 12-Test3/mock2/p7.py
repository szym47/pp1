# (p7.py) A computer system registers all entries into the car park ("in") and exits from the car park ("out"). Define a function f(d) that for the registered data d returns an array containing the registration numbers of vehicles that remain in the car park, in alphabetical order. Example:
# cars = [["KR234","in"],["BA123","in"],["GX444","in"],["KR234","out"], ["BA111","in"],["BA123","out"],["KR234","in"]]
# f(cars)  ["BA111","GX444","KR234"]
# cars1 = [["KR234","in"],["KR234","out"]]
# f(cars1)  []
