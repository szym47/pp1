# (p6.py) A valid number on the planet Metis consists of digits 1 to 7 and lowercase or uppercase letters a to d. A plus (+) or minus (-) sign may also appear at the beginning of the number. The mnumbers array contains sample numbers. Create a function f(mnumbers) that returns how many numbers in the array that are valid in the planet Metis. Example:
# f(["A15","-31","7abC","+D1","-gH"])  5
# f(["A05","-3+1","7ab8C","+D1","-22k"])  1
