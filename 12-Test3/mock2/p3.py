# (p3.py) Flight numbers along with the number of passengers are stored in a dictionary d. Define a function f(d) that returns the number of flights in which the number of passengers is greater than the average number of passengers on all flights. Example:
# f({"LO231":150,"BA787":120,"NZ15":30})  2
# f({"LO231":150,"BA787":20,"NZ15":30})  1
