# 45.	A natural number greater than 1 is called a prime if it has exactly 2 natural factors with the values 1 and this number. 
# Write a program that finds N leading prime numbers. Read the value of N from the keyboard. 
# Using loop statements check that the number N is divisible only by 1 and by N.
